## General Info
This landing page is my fourth Front-End Mentor challenge. Through this project, I learned the basis of SCSS and practice the grid-system. Here's the detail of what I had to reproduce : 

> ### The challenge
> Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

> ### Your users should be able to:

> View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
> See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
> The input field is empty
> The email address is not formatted correctly


## Design
For this challenge, I decided to use the css grid system for the first time. It turned out to be a good solution since it's easy to adapt for responsive layout. 

## Technologies
